# Malware Description Classifier (MDC)

## What is MDC?

The Malware Description Classifier (MDC) is an LLM-like tool that people can use to understand and identify potential threats on their systems. Our MDC uses an online API and the use of a machine learning model to analyze threats with only a simple description of the problems on the system. For more detailed information about our planning and project timeline, here is our [project proposal](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Kx4bnz9mbq9hF8orHty4ZB7MPR3aaZ2bFset0Z0KAIY/edit?usp=sharing)

# Developers
- **Agilan Gunashankar**: Machine learning model and calling VirusTotal API
- **Gana Visank Ventrapragada**: Parsing raw data via SQL to use for ML model
- **Ismail Mohammad**: Front-end implementation and assistance for back-end components
- **Saishashank Bhagavatula**: Connecting front-end and back-end components

# Environment Setup
## 1. Prerequisites

Ensure that you have the following prerequisites installed on your system:

- Python (version 3.6 or higher)
- Pip (Python package installer)
- Git
- MySQL server

## 2. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/CS222-UIUC-FA23/group-project-team93.git
cd group-project-team93
```

## 3. Set Up Python Environment

```bash
pip install virtualenv
virtualenv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
```

## 4. Install Required Libraries

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
This will install the necessary Python libraries, including TensorFlow, PyTorch, scikit-learn, and others.

## 5. Database Setup
Ensure that you have a MySQL server running and update the database connection details in the *'config.py'* file.
```bash
# config.py
DB_HOST = 'your_mysql_host'
DB_USER = 'your_mysql_user'
DB_PASSWORD = 'your_mysql_password'
DB_NAME = 'mdc_database'
```

## 6. Run Backend
```bash
python backend.py
```

This will start the backend server with machine learning models, connecting to the MySQL database.

## 7. Run Frontend
```bash
python frontend.py
```
Access the MDC website by navigating to http://localhost:your_port in your web browser.

## 8. Explore the MDC Website
* Use the provided input fields to simulate malware descriptions and observe the classification results.
* Explore the various features, including the integration with the VirusTotal API, user feedback, and database interactions.

## 9. Testing
For testing the backend components:

```bash
python -m unittest discover -s tests
```

For frontend user interface testing with Selenium:

```bash
# Ensure that you have the latest version of ChromeDriver installed
python -m unittest discover -s tests_ui
```

## 10. Contribute and Collaborate
Feel free to contribute to the project by opening issues, proposing enhancements, or submitting pull requests on GitHub.
